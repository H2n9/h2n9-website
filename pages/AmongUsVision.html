            <li>SIFT detections are used to track feature movements over time.</li>
            <li>Object detection is being used to determine map origin so that the cumulative position can be centered correctly. This also helps to correct for the occasional drift.</li>
            <li>The map has been roughly drawn from walkable space and could potentially be used to direct player movements automatically with a simple pathfinding algorithm.</li>
            <li>Further markers could also be placed on the map to inform about potential gameplay mechanics at each position.</li>
